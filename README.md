## The reason I tried to change this website.

### 📍https://www.nyxcosmetics.com
> This is original NYX website 

When I open the website, It was hard to focus on the product or ads. 
So I tried to make layout simple and wide to emphasize the products. 
And I felt that the color combination is not going well, I tried to chagned the color 
into **Black and Purple** To emphasize their genderless concept. 




 ## I tried to change like this. 

1. Deleting 2 ads part, To make it clear. When people see lots of ads at the same times. I think It makes more hard to focus on

2. Trying to use black, gray, light purple colors to emphasize their **genderless character** 

3. Even though There has detailed page about the products but do not post it detailed so, I tried to make detail to explain the product

4. To introduce users, I put Instagram post (under the main webpage)about their product and tried to explain, how to use the products through that

5. For making it user-friendly, I made 'TOP' button for users that they do not have to scroll all the way back to the top 



## What I change in code

As you can see I used lots of slider on my website, but I made everything with jQuery. 
So I tried to re-coded with javascript by myself. 
And for making it user-friednly I made 'TOP' button but as you can feel, I made it a bit slower than original so it is way better to use it. 




#### Changed css code 

I didn't know using **':root'** element before so wrote every element values by myself, even though I kept writing same values. 
So After studying **':root'** element so I changed it like this

## What I like the most on my website 

1. I really like the color on the website. I found out that When I open the NYX website, It is a bit distracted because of the colors. 
So I tried to find the perfect color that Show their **genderless character** and easy to focus on the products

2. I made **'top button**. As one of a website user, I sometimes found out the annoyed part when website do not offer 'back to top' button. 
So I put it in for users.

3. In product detailed part, When you scroll down the page, The right side cart part is following. So you do not have to scroll all the way to re-check your 
options.

4. In main page, I twisted **BEST SELLERS** part in a fun way! Using circle shapes, and changed layout into fun way. So it looks interesting to the user.
